## What is JW Time?

**JW Time** is a time tracking, 'calls', return visits, territory tracking app that [gamifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) the tracking of [field service](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/door-to-door/).

## What can JW Time do?

**JW Time** is focused on being a simple to use app that optionally provides pioneer power-users extra functionality as needed. Some basic features include:

- Track call information
  > Note: "Calls" refers to an individual person.
- Track 'visits', which may automatically update calls to a 'study' & more.
  > Note: A "visit" is an event where you spoke/contacted the individual. A call becomes a "study" when there are 3 or more visits associated with them.
- Typical metrics: Hours, Placements, Videos, Return Visits, Studies
  > Return visits and studies are automatically calculated based on visits to a call. You may optionally offset these values for any return visits/studies you are not tracking in the app.
- Territory tracking
  > Streets, photos of territory, streets, not-at-homes and more.
- Door-To-Door mode:
  > Focused mode that allows quick-adds of streets, not-at-homes, do-not-calls and more to a territory.

## Does JW Time work in my language?

**Possibly**. As languages become available, you can select them in the app: **Dashboard > Settings > Language**. Localization is a feature that I need your help with. If you'd like to assist in the translation of this app, please email me at chelleas123@gmail.com or create a [pull request](https://github.com/leviFrosty/JW-Time/pulls). Your help is greatly appreciated!
